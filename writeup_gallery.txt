web challenge galleria-

step 1. when looking at the developer console we can find a strange code snippet which indicates that there might be a directory traversal exploit..
we check it out: http://host/get_files_items.php?debug=FALSE&folder=images
we are getting a message:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEBUG Message: Getting a list op all the files in folder: images from the param folder using PHP function 'glob'.

Code Debug:
$folder = $_REQUEST["folder"];
$pictues = glob($folder . "/*");
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
hmm interesting, maybe we can use it to get to different folders?
yep. when using folder=../ parameter we get to a folder which contains clue_folder_good_job
inside it we find the clue:

Well Done!
The developer wrote the secret key somewhere on machine...
Clue: The file you are using to exploit has an older version somewhere, good luck.

with a little bit more searching we find php_folder_cant_find_me_by_brute_force directory.
inside it we find the older version file.
old_get_files_items.php
remembering from the newer file there was a ?debug=True parameter.
trying it on this file works aswell and we get the debug message:
Code Debug:
$file = $_REQUEST["file"];
print file_get_contents($file);

after that, we can finally read some files.
going into the /home/developer_user directory we find a clue message and the flag, 
the clue message reads:

Good job! you are almost done, but you can't read the flag...

hmm, maybe trying to get root is overkill, lets try to get the commands log.
php_folder_cant_find_me_by_brute_force/old_get_files_items.php?debug=True&file=/home/developer_user/.bash_history
and thats it! we found the flag!
echo S1FLAG.xDI0UiExW4pALibNe8aq4BDvHuk > SECRET_KEY
